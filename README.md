# TickTick MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for TickTick that enables interacting with your TickTick task management system directly through Claude and other MCP clients.

## Features

- üìã View all your TickTick projects and tasks
- ‚úèÔ∏è Create new projects and tasks through natural language
- üîÑ Update existing task details (title, content, dates, priority)
- ‚úÖ Mark tasks as complete
- üóëÔ∏è Delete tasks and projects
- üîÑ Full integration with TickTick's open API
- üîå Seamless integration with Claude and other MCP clients
- üê≥ Docker support for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- TickTick account with API access
- TickTick API credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Access Token)
- (Optional) Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment

## Installation

### Standard Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parkjs814/ticktick-mcp.git
   cd ticktick-mcp
   ```

2. **Install with uv**:
   ```bash
   # Install uv if you don't have it already
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Create a virtual environment
   uv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install the package
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Authenticate with TickTick**:
   ```bash
   # Run the authentication flow
   uv run -m ticktick_mcp.cli auth
   ```

   This will:
   - Ask for your TickTick Client ID and Client Secret
   - Open a browser window for you to log in to TickTick
   - Automatically save your access tokens to a `.env` file

4. **Test your configuration**:
   ```bash
   uv run test_server.py
   ```
   This will verify that your TickTick credentials are working correctly.

### Docker Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parkjs814/ticktick-mcp.git
   cd ticktick-mcp
   ```

2. **Initialize environment file**:
   ```bash
   ./setup-env.sh
   ```
   This will create a `.env` file from the `.env.template`.

3. **Configure TickTick credentials**:
   Edit the `.env` file with your TickTick Client ID and Client Secret.
   For Docker environments, you may need to specify your host machine's IP address or hostname for the redirect URI:
   ```
   TICKTICK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   TICKTICK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   TICKTICK_REDIRECT_URI=http://your_host_ip_or_hostname:8000/callback
   ```

4. **Run the authentication process**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --service-ports ticktick-auth
   ```
   If a browser doesn't open automatically, open the URL displayed in the console.

5. **Run the MCP server**:
   Once authenticated, you can start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up ticktick-mcp
   ```

## Authentication with TickTick

This server uses OAuth2 to authenticate with TickTick. The setup process is straightforward:

1. Register your application at the [TickTick Developer Center](https://developer.ticktick.com/manage)
   - Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8000/callback`
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

2. Run the authentication command:
   ```bash
   uv run -m ticktick_mcp.cli auth
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your Client ID and Client Secret

4. A browser window will open for you to authorize the application with your TickTick account

5. After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to the application, and your access tokens will be automatically saved to the `.env` file

The server handles token refresh automatically, so you won't need to reauthenticate unless you revoke access or delete your `.env` file.

## Usage with Claude for Desktop

1. Install [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Edit your Claude for Desktop configuration file:

   **macOS**:
   ```bash
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   **Windows**:
   ```bash
   notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. Add the TickTick MCP server configuration, using absolute paths:
   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "ticktick": {
            "command": "<absolute path to uv>",
            "args": ["run", "--directory", "<absolute path to ticktick-mcp directory>", "-m", "ticktick_mcp.cli", "run"]
         }
      }
   }
   ```

4. Restart Claude for Desktop

Once connected, you'll see the TickTick MCP server tools available in Claude, indicated by the üî® (tools) icon.

### Development with Docker

When developing with Docker, you can use the following workflow:

1. **Make changes to the code** on your local machine.

2. **Rebuild the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Run tests or the server**:
   ```bash
   # Run the server
   docker-compose up ticktick-mcp
   
   # Or run tests
   docker-compose run ticktick-mcp python test_server.py
   ```

4. **View logs** for debugging:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f ticktick-mcp
   ```

5. **Access a shell in the container** for debugging:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm ticktick-mcp bash
   ```

### Authentication Flow

The project implements a complete OAuth 2.0 flow for TickTick:

1. **Initial Setup**: User provides their TickTick API Client ID and Secret
2. **Browser Authorization**: User is redirected to TickTick to grant access
3. **Token Reception**: A local server receives the OAuth callback with the authorization code
4. **Token Exchange**: The code is exchanged for access and refresh tokens
5. **Token Storage**: Tokens are securely stored in the local `.env` file
6. **Token Refresh**: The client automatically refreshes the access token when it expires

This simplifies the user experience by handling the entire OAuth flow programmatically.
